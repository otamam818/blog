# The origins of this blog

Hi, I am Tahmin. I hope you have a wonderful journey seeing this blog grow
with me.

I am a passionate - albeit still amateur - software developer, who
tries to improve his GitHub account on a daily basis. I learned that a blog is
essential for a programmer to outline the journey that they have when:
- Developing a project
- Learning and teaching a new technology
- Better-understand the state of things in any field they are interested in
and so, as I am working on my first attempt of a FOSS software - my Personal
Finance Tracker App - I decided that is finally time to start my own blog.

That made me question myself: What is the best way to start this blog?
